# etherum_smart_contracts

1. hello_world.sol
  - It is the first contract deploy into the blockchain
  - It shows the simple structure of the contract

2. counter_v2.sol
  - It is a smart contract that shows a counter that adds up everytime the contract is executed

3. power.sol
  - It shows the idea of how the class can initialize and calculate something at the starting point of the contract

4. self_destruct.sol
  - It shows how the contract is going to be destroy and stop interacting with the rest of the community.

5. lottery.sol
  - A simple code that shows how the function works, and how we can store the data of the users into the system.

6. factory_counter.sol
  - Learning how to leverage a class in other to create other counters for other people instead of just the owner.

7. embark_demo
  - It shows how the contract can interact with the JS application.

8. MDB
  - it shows an example of inheritence and how that can be leveraged.

9. ideas
  - For all the tutorials that are just snippet of an idea or technique, they are hosted there using embark. So I don't have to deploy the contract manually with the Ethereum client.
  * There is something weird with the Proof of existence file, i cannot name the contract as stated from the tutorial or the embark app breaks.
