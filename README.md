# etherum_smart_contracts

1. hello_world.sol
  - It is the first contract deploy into the blockchain
  - It shows the simple structure of the contract

2. counter_v2.sol
  - It is a smart contract that shows a counter that adds up everytime the contract is executed

3. power.sol
  - It shows the idea of how the class can initialize and calculate something at the starting point of the contract

4. self_destruct.sol
  - It shows how the contract is going to be destroy and stop interacting with the rest of the community.

5. lottery.sol
  - A simple code that shows how the function works, and how we can store the data of the users into the system.

6. factory_counter.sol
  - Learning how to leverage a class in other to create other counters for other people instead of just the owner.

7. embark_demo
  - It shows how the contract can interact with the JS application.

8. MDB
  - it shows an example of inheritence and how that can be leveraged.

9. ideas
  - For all the tutorials that are just snippet of an idea or technique, they are hosted there using embark. So I don't have to deploy the contract manually with the Ethereum client.
  * There is something weird with the Proof of existence file, i cannot name the contract as stated from the tutorial or the embark app breaks.

10. I finished the examples of solidity contract from the main site. I reported and did two pull request to change things that were not working in the examples;

11. I finished a quick review of Javascript, even thought not directly related to Solidity, but it helps.

12. I'm starting to play with Zeppelin Solidity.

13. It's not easy to use Truffle. The examples are not working as expected.

14. Finished the Truffle pet shop example, need to either make some architectural choice about the DAPP part.

  - Should I continue in the Solidity part or move to a more wholesome approach for Dapp development?
  - I approached people on LinkedIn and email to see if they have some ideas of where I should head to to learn more.
